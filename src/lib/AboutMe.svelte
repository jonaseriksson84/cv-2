  <p>
    I am a fullstack web developer with 10+ years of professional experience. I
    particularly enjoy doing frontend development and JavaScript, though also
    comfortable with backend and API development in a number of languages such
    as Python, Java and server-side JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a social person and thrive in a strong team, but I am also full of
    initiative and drive â€“ I will quickly learn new processes, environments and
    technologies on my own. Regardless of project, I always carry a professional
    attitude and clear focus on delivering results.
